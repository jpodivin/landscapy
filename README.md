# testfuncpy
Library of various test functions for benchmarking optimization algorithms. 

Spun off from my [pystrand](https://github.com/jpodivin/pystrand) project in order to formalize management. 

The name is mostly a placeholder. I couldn't compe up with a better one, or didn't try.
So it will be subject to change, probably.
